  abstract = "High-occupancy target (HOT) regions are segments of the genome
              with unusually high number of transcription factor binding sites.
              These regions are observed in multiple species and thought to
              have biological importance due to high transcription factor
              occupancy. Furthermore, they coincide with house-keeping gene
              promoters and consequently associated genes are stably expressed
              across multiple cell types. Despite these features, HOT regions
              are solely defined using ChIP-seq experiments and shown to lack
              canonical motifs for transcription factors that are thought to be
              bound there. Although, ChIP-seq experiments are the golden
              standard for finding genome-wide binding sites of a protein, they
              are not noise free. Here, we show that HOT regions are likely to
              be ChIP-seq artifacts and they are similar to previously proposed
              'hyper-ChIPable' regions. Using ChIP-seq data sets for
              knocked-out transcription factors, we demonstrate presence of
              false positive signals on HOT regions. We observe sequence
              characteristics and genomic features that are discriminatory of
              HOT regions, such as GC/CpG-rich k-mers, enrichment of RNA-DNA
              hybrids (R-loops) and DNA tertiary structures (G-quadruplex DNA).
              The artificial ChIP-seq enrichment on HOT regions could be
              associated to these discriminatory features. Furthermore, we
              propose strategies to deal with such artifacts for the future
              ChIP-seq studies.",

              Several sets of optimised matrix cut-off values are built in the
              system to provide a variety of search modes of different
              stringency. The user may construct and save his/her specific user
              profiles which are selected subsets of matrices including default

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: A motif is a short DNA or protein sequence that
              contributes to the biological function of the sequence in which
              it resides. Over the past several decades, many computational
              methods have been described for identifying, characterizing and
              searching with sequence motifs. Critical to nearly any
              motif-based sequence analysis pipeline is the ability to scan a
              sequence database for occurrences of a given motif described by a
              position-specific frequency matrix. RESULTS: We describe Find
              Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO), a software tool for scanning
              DNA or protein sequences with motifs described as
              position-specific scoring matrices. The program computes a
              log-likelihood ratio score for each position in a given sequence
              database, uses established dynamic programming methods to convert
              this score to a P-value and then applies false discovery rate
              analysis to estimate a q-value for each position in the given
              sequence. FIMO provides output in a variety of formats, including
              HTML, XML and several Santa Cruz Genome Browser formats. The
              program is efficient, allowing for the scanning of DNA sequences
              at a rate of 3.5 Mb/s on a single CPU. AVAILABILITY AND
              IMPLEMENTATION: FIMO is part of the MEME Suite software toolkit.

  author   = "Zhong, Shan and He, Xin and Bar-Joseph, Ziv",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Studies of gene regulation often utilize genome-wide
              predictions of transcription factor (TF) binding sites. Most
              existing prediction methods are based on sequence information
              alone, ignoring biological contexts such as developmental stages
              and tissue types. Experimental methods to study in vivo binding,
              including ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq, can only study one
              transcription factor in a single cell type and under a specific
              condition in each experiment, and therefore cannot scale to
              determine the full set of regulatory interactions in mammalian
              transcriptional regulatory networks. RESULTS: We developed a new
              computational approach, PIPES, for predicting tissue-specific TF
              binding. PIPES integrates in vitro protein binding microarrays
              (PBMs), sequence conservation and tissue-specific epigenetic
              (DNase I hypersensitivity) information. We demonstrate that PIPES
              improves over existing methods on distinguishing between in vivo
              bound and unbound sequences using ChIP-seq data for 11 mouse TFs.
              In addition, our predictions are in good agreement with current
              knowledge of tissue-specific TF regulation. CONCLUSIONS: We
              provide a systematic map of computationally predicted
              tissue-specific binding targets for 284 mouse TFs across 55
              tissue/cell types. Such comprehensive resource is useful for
              researchers studying gene regulation.",

  abstract = "Accurate reconstruction of the regulatory networks that control
              gene expression is one of the key current challenges in molecular
              biology. Although gene expression and chromatin state dynamics
              are ultimately encoded by constellations of binding sites
              recognized by regulators such as transcriptions factors (TFs) and
              microRNAs (miRNAs), our understanding of this regulatory code and
              its context-dependent read-out remains very limited. Given that
              there are thousands of potential regulators in mammals, it is not
              practical to use direct experimentation to identify which of
              these play a key role for a particular system of interest. We
              developed a methodology that models gene expression or chromatin
              modifications in terms of genome-wide predictions of regulatory
              sites and completely automated it into a web-based tool called
              ISMARA (Integrated System for Motif Activity Response Analysis).
              Given only gene expression or chromatin state data across a set
              of samples as input, ISMARA identifies the key TFs and miRNAs
              driving expression/chromatin changes and makes detailed
              predictions regarding their regulatory roles. These include
              predicted activities of the regulators across the samples, their
              genome-wide targets, enriched gene categories among the targets,
              and direct interactions between the regulators. Applying ISMARA
              to data sets from well-studied systems, we show that it
              consistently identifies known key regulators ab initio. We also
              present a number of novel predictions including regulatory
              interactions in innate immunity, a master regulator of
              mucociliary differentiation, TFs consistently disregulated in
              cancer, and TFs that mediate specific chromatin modifications.",

              information in regulatory elements is a key step in systems-level
              investigation of transcriptional regulation. Here, we have
              developed a novel tool, IMAGE, for precise prediction of causal
              transcription factors based on transcriptome profiling and
              genome-wide maps of enhancer activity. High precision is obtained
              by combining a near-complete database of position weight matrices
              (PWMs), generated by compiling public databases and systematic
              prediction of PWMs for uncharacterized transcription factors,
              with a state-of-the-art method for PWM scoring and a novel
              machine learning strategy, based on both enhancers and promoters,
              to predict the contribution of motifs to transcriptional
              activity. We applied IMAGE to published data obtained during
              3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and showed that IMAGE predicts
              causal transcriptional regulators of this process with higher
              confidence than existing methods. Furthermore, we generated
              genome-wide maps of enhancer activity and transcripts during
              human mesenchymal stem cell commitment and adipocyte
              differentiation and used IMAGE to identify positive and negative
              transcriptional regulators of this process. Collectively, our
              results demonstrate that IMAGE is a powerful and precise method
